# TODO List 

- repair tailwind integration that seems to be broken since nuxt3 and nuxt content v2  
=> the tailwind config is not loaded anymore, so, the animation is not working anymore on the home page

- add a new RSS feed using https://github.com/jpmonette/feed

- check syntax highlighting

- repair related articles 

- remark youtube etc..
